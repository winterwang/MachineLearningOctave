% Initialize matrix A 
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6;7, 8, 9] 

% Initialize vector v 
v = [1; 1; 1] 

% Multiply A * v
Av = A * v


% Initialize a 3 by 2 matrix 
A = [1, 2; 3, 4;5, 6]

% Initialize a 2 by 1 matrix 
B = [1; 2] 

% We expect a resulting matrix of (3 by 2)*(2 by 1) = (3 by 1) 
mult_AB = A*B

% Make sure you understand why we got that result


% Initialize random matrices A and B 
A = [1,2;4,5]
B = [1,1;0,2]

% Initialize a 2 by 2 identity matrix
I = eye(2)

% The above notation is the same as I = [1,0;0,1]

% What happens when we multiply I*A ? 
IA = I*A 

% How about A*I ? 
AI = A*I 

% Compute A*B 
AB = A*B 

% Is it equal to B*A? 
BA = B*A 

% Note that IA = AI but AB != BA

% matrix and inverse of matrix 

A = [3, 4 ; 2, 16]

inverseofA = pinv(A)

A * inverseofA


% Initialize matrix A 
A = [1,2,0;0,5,6;7,0,9]

% Transpose A 
A_trans = A' 

% Take the inverse of A 
A_inv = inv(A)

% What is A^(-1)*A? 
A_invA = inv(A)*A
